We would like to thank COMP40 TA James Cameron, Josh Simani, Leila Minowada
for their help

We spent approximately 4 hours analyzing this assignment,
12 hours writing the assembly code, 2 hours debugging the code

We believe everything has been properly implemented.

The only departure from our initial design was creating an additional stack
as a temporary stack. This was needed for our print function so that we could
restore the original stack after popping off all the values.

The print module was implemented by iterating through the number popped
off from the top of the stack (stored in r4). Recursively stores each digit
into a stack (r2) and then recursively pops off from this stack and outputs
each digit (one at a time).
